#EMPLOYEE DISTRIBUTION REPORT

The Employee Distribution Dashboard is a powerful tool designed to analyze workforce distribution across various parameters, such as departments, roles, locations, and tenure. This project uses SQL for data extraction and transformation and Power BI for interactive data visualization.

By leveraging this dashboard, organizations can make data-driven decisions about workforce management, resource allocation, and diversity initiatives.

###steps followed

Step 1: Load the Dataset into SQL Prepare your CSV files containing employee data. Set up a new SQL database and create tables based on the structure of the CSV files. Load the data from the CSV files into the corresponding SQL tables.

Step 2: Prepare the Database and Queries Design the database schema Write SQL queries to clean, aggregate, and transform the data. Create tables and load data using the appropriate SQL queries or by using data import wizard tool.

step 3: Data Cleaning.


Step 4: Write SQL Queries for Data Analysis Write SQL queries to analyze the data and answer key business questions: Employee distribution by department. Gender and role distribution. Employee tenure and experience levels across different departments. Export the results of your queries into CSV files for further analysis or use in Power BI.

Step 5: Use Power BI for Data Visualization Import the cleaned and transformed data (CSV files or direct SQL connection) into Power BI. Create data models and define relationships between tables. Build visualizations to represent key insights (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, maps).

Step 6: Prepare the Power BI Dashboard Combine multiple visualizations into an interactive dashboard. Add filters and slicers for users to explore the data by department, location, or role. Finalize the dashboard design and ensure itâ€™s easy to navigate.
